\para{Main outcomes.} \Tabref{tab:main_results} summarizes the paired comparison across 30 markets. \marketprompt yields large gains in plausibility and alignment, with $p<10^{-5}$ and large effect sizes. Probability error drops to near zero under \marketprompt, while coherence remains at a ceiling of 5.0 in both conditions. Hedging rate and word count changes are small and not statistically significant.

\para{Market distribution.} \Figref{fig:market_hist} shows the distribution of market probabilities in the sampled markets. The sample spans low- to high-probability events, with a mean near 0.48, providing a balanced test bed for calibration.

\para{Plausibility and alignment.} The boxplots in \Figref{fig:plausibility} and \Figref{fig:alignment} show a consistent shift upward for \marketprompt across markets. This indicates that explicit probabilities lead the model to adopt more cautious, believable narratives that better reflect uncertainty.

\para{Probability error.} \Figref{fig:prob_error} shows the absolute deviation between the judge's implied probability and the market prior. \marketprompt reduces error to near zero across the sample.
