\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We study whether prediction-market priors can improve LLM-generated ``news from the future.'' By conditioning prompts on market probabilities, we obtain narratives that are more plausible and better aligned with probabilistic priors, while preserving coherence and length. The key takeaway is that market probabilities are an effective, low-cost prior for uncertainty-aware narrative generation. Future work should add human evaluation, use historical market snapshots to avoid leakage, and test broader market sources and tone-calibration controls.
