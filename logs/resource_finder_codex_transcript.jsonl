These benchmarks also fall short\nin assessing how LLM performance changes over\ntime, as they consist of a static set of questions\nwithout a temporal dimension. To address these\nlimitations, we propose using future event predic-\ntion as a continuous evaluation method to assess\nLLMs’ temporal generalization and forecasting\nabilities. Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, auto-\nmatically generates question-answer (QA) pairs\nfrom daily news, challenging LLMs to predict\n“future” event outcomes. Our findings reveal that\nas pre-training data becomes outdated, LLM per-\nformance degrades over time. While Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) has the potential\nto enhance prediction accuracy, the performance\ndegradation pattern persists, highlighting the need\nfor continuous model updates. Code and data\nare available at https://agenticlearning.ai/daily-\noracle.\n1. Introduction\nTraditional Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks are\noften static, and do not reflect real-world information that\nevolves over time. This presents two significant challenges.\nFirst, as LLMs are updated, there is a risk that static bench-\nmarks become outdated and more vulnerable to data leak-\nage, where their content might end up in the training data\nof newer models. This undermines the reliability of per-\nformance assessments on these benchmarks (Sainz et al.,\n2023; Xu et al., 2024; McIntosh et al., 2025; Li & Flanigan,\n2024). Second, static benchmarks often lack temporal in-\n1New York University.

PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025\nby the author(s).\nformation, making it difficult to track models’ performance\nvariations over time (McIntosh et al., 2025). This creates\na need for evaluation methods that always remain relevant\nand incorporate temporal dynamics.\nDaily news provides a natural setting for continuous eval-\nuation of LLMs. Since the world is constantly changing,\na benchmark designed around forecasting the next day’s\nnews will never be out of date by construction. In addition\nto enabling continuous evaluation, forecasting is itself a\nlongstanding challenge with significant implications across\nvarious domains, including healthcare, finance, and policy-\nmaking (Tetlock & Gardner, 2016; Dempsey et al., 2017;\nGillingham et al., 2018; Lopez-Lira & Tang, 2023). While\nhuman experts have traditionally made such forecasts, ma-\nchine learning models, particularly LLMs, have emerged as\npromising alternatives due to their ability to learn from vast\nand diverse corpora (Halawi et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024; Yan\net al., 2024). Several recent forecasting question-answer\n(QA) datasets have been developed (Jin et al., 2021; Zou\net al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024), however, they are limited\nin either size, scope, or they do not continuously keep pace\nwith the rapidly changing world. More critically, the ex-\ntent to which LLMs’ predictive abilities change over time\nremains understudied.\nIn this work, we propose Daily Oracle—a continuous eval-\nuation benchmark that uses automatically generated QA\npairs from daily news to assess how the future prediction\ncapabilities of LLMs evolve over time. The QA pairs are\ngenerated on a daily basis, consisting of True/False (TF) and\nMultiple Choice (MC) questions across various categories\nsuch as business, politics, and arts. Unlike traditional read-\ning comprehension tasks, these QA pairs are designed to\nchallenge LLMs to predict future events based on their own\nexisting knowledge, effectively evaluating their temporal\ngeneralization and forecasting abilities.\nWe continuously evaluate various LLMs, both with and\nwithout access to a limited archive of news articles. Our\nexperiments reveal that LLMs experience significant per-\nformance degradation between January 2020 and Decem-\nber 2024, with degradation becoming more pronounced\nbefore and after the models’ knowledge cutoff dates. On\naverage, performance drops by 21.55% on TF questions\n1\nAre LLMs Prescient? A Continuous Evaluation using Daily News as the Oracle\nand 11.33% on MC questions. While model performance\ncan be improved with more recent news articles using Re-\ntrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020),\nthe downward trend persists, suggesting the challenge in\nmaintaining its prediction ability over time.\nTo summarize, our key contributions are two-fold:\n• Continuous Forecasting Evaluation Benchmark: We\npresent Daily Oracle, the largest and most up-to-date fore-\ncasting dataset, composed of automatically generated QA\npairs. This benchmark continuously evaluates LLMs’ tem-\nporal generalization and future prediction abilities using\ndaily news, ensuring relevance over time and offering a\nchallenging evaluation framework.\n• Empirical Findings on Performance Degradation :\nSince our benchmark provides new questions each day,\nwe can study how model performance changes along the\ntemporal axis. Our work effectively reveals a clear per-\nformance degradation pattern in LLMs’ forecasting accu-\nracy over time. Additionally, we study how this pattern\nchanges as the LLMs are given access to updated knowl-\nedge up to different times. Surprisingly, we find that,even\nwhen the model has access to recent information in\nan “open-book” setting, it still experiences performance\ndegradation. Moreover, the sheer degree of decline, along\nwith its smoothness over time, was unexpected. On the\none hand, this highlights the problems with outdated LLM\npre-training data and on the other hand underscores the\nneed for continuous model updating.\n2. Related Work\nTemporal Generalization of LLMs. Lazaridou et al.\n(2021) define temporal generalization as the ability of Lan-\nguage Models to generalize well to future data from beyond\ntheir training period. They demonstrate that Transformer-\nXL’s performance deteriorates over time, evidenced by in-\ncreasing perplexity when evaluated on post-training data.\nHowever, perplexity-based metrics have two main limi-\ntations: they cannot be applied to closed-source models\nlacking accessible logits, and increased perplexity does not\nnecessarily indicate degraded performance on downstream\ntasks (R¨ottger & Pierrehumbert, 2021; Agarwal & Nenkova,\n2022). Zhu et al. (2025) investigate temporal generaliza-\ntion using the Bits Per Character (BPC) metric. Similar to\nperplexity, BPC fails to capture higher-level performance\non downstream tasks. In contrast, our work focuses on the\ndownstream forecasting task, evaluating how well models\nunderstand world knowledge and make predictions. This\napproach offers a more reliable evaluation of temporal gen-\neralization with direct relevance to real-world applications\nand public interest.\nDynamic QA Datasets. While static QA datasets evaluate\nmodels on fixed knowledge snapshots, dynamic QA datasets\nincorporate a temporal dimension, allowing assessment of\nhow models adapt to evolving information. Several dynamic\nQA datasets are proposed. Chen et al. (2021) construct\nTimeQA by using time-sensitive facts in WikiData with\naligned Wikipedia passages to synthesize QA pairs. Zhang\n& Choi (2021) introduce SituatedQA by manually anno-\ntating temporally and geographically dependent questions.\nStreamingQA (Liska et al., 2022) and RealtimeQA (Kasai\net al., 2024) are both dynamic benchmarks with QA pairs an-\nswerable from news articles. StreamingQA, however, does\nnot provide continuous evaluation with always-relevant data.\nRealTimeQA does not address forecasting and is more like\na plugin for a search engine, in the sense that it tests whether\na model has updated its knowledge as facts change, rather\nthan testing whether it can predict what will change given its\nknowledge of the past. FreshQA (Vu et al., 2024) contains\na fixed set of human-written open-ended questions whose\nanswers by nature can change based on new developments\nin the world, but is smaller and does not address forecasting.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Zhu\net al. (2025) introduce FreshBench, a forecasting dataset\nscraped from the Good Judgment Open platform, and also\nstudy temporal generalization. However, they report accu-\nracy in a relatively short time window (from January 2023 to\nAugust 2024) with only 2,769 questions.

In contrast, our automatically generated dataset has\nbroad event coverage, consistent growth, and more uniform\nquestion quality over time.1\nIn order to clearly showcase the differences between our\ndataset and prior work, we highlight a few key features in\nTable 1.

Additionally, at the fixed size we use for\nanalysis we provide significantly more evaluation examples\nthan the other automatically updated benchmarks.\n3. The Daily Oracle Dataset\nIn this section, we present Daily Oracle, a continuously\nupdated QA benchmark of forecasting questions that are\nautomatically generated from daily news. For our current\nanalysis of LLM performance, we utilize a subset of the\ndata consisting of 16,783 TF questions and 14,727 MC\nquestions, covering a diverse range of forecasting topics,\nwhich are generated using daily news articles from January\n2020 up until December 2024. However, our QA generation\nframework is continuous and updates daily. In Section 3.1,\nwe describe our LLM-based dataset construction pipeline,\ndetailing the data sources and the four-step construction pro-\ncess. Section 3.2 provides an analysis and general overview\nof the dataset. Lastly, in Section 3.3, we conduct a human\nevaluation, similar to our QA filtering process, to verify the\nquality of the generated QA pairs.\n3.1. Dataset Construction\nData Source. Following Zou et al. (2022), we collect\na large corpus of news articles from the daily-updated\nCommon Crawl News Dataset (Nagel, 2016) with the\nnews-please package (Hamborg et al., 2017). To fur-\nther enrich our news dataset, we supplement it with daily\nscraped news using the Newspaper3k package.2 We filter\nfor mainstream sources—CBS News, CNBC, CNN, Forbes,\nand NPR. While our data collection and evaluation are per-\nformed daily, for this study we utilize a static news corpus\n2https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n3\n\n\n=== 2025_dai_daily_oracle_chunk_002.pdf ===\nAre LLMs Prescient? A Continuous Evaluation using Daily News as the Oracle\nwith 1,246,973 English articles spanning January 2019 to\nDecember 2024. This corpus is also used for the constrained\nopen-book evaluation setting in Section 4.1.\nLLM-based Construction Process. QA pairs are gen-\nerated from articles published between January 2020 and\nDecember 2024.3 For each day, we select six articles for\nQA generation: three are chosen randomly, and three are\nselected from hot topics.4 For each selected article, we then\nuse LLM to generate two TF QA pairs and two MC QA\npairs with the few-shot prompting technique.5\nWe adopt the methodology of Zhang et al. (2024), as their\nprompt design largely suits our setting. To further filter\nthe QA pairs, we establish seven key criteria to ensure they\nqualify as valid forecasting questions, incorporating these\ninto a QA Filtering step. The QA construction follows four\nsteps, as illustrated in Figure 7:\n(1) Article Summary. We generate a summary for each\narticle, focusing on new events from the publishing\ndate, instead of opinion articles discussing events from\nthe past. This approach allows us to use the publication\ndate as the resolution date of the generated question.\nQuestions can then be regarded as valid forecasting\nquestions since they are prior to the resolution date.\n(2) QA Generation. After filtering out the articles that do\nnot introduce new events, two TF questions and two\nMC questions are generated together with the answers\nper article. To ensure balance in the TF questions, we\ninstruct the LLM to generate the first question with a\n“Yes” answer and the second with a “No.”\n(3) Misleading Choices Generation. For MC, we provide\nthe article, its publishing date, and the QA pair to the\nLLM, which then generates three misleading choices.\n(4) QA Filtering. We prompt the LLM to check seven prin-\nciples: correctness of answers, non-answerability before\nthe publication date, absence of information leakage,\nobjectivity, inclusion of a clear temporal element, pub-\nlic interest, and non-obviousness of the answer. Each\nprinciple is scored with 0, 1, or 2 points, and we se-\nlected the questions that received at least 13 points in\ntotal. These principles are detailed in Appendix A.3.\nWe use GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2024a) or GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI,\n2024b) for steps (1) and (4), while GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)\nor GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024b) is utilized for steps (2) and (3)\nto ensure high data quality.6\n3For news articles in 2019, we use them as the corpus for the\nconstrained open-book setting.\n4See Appendix A.2 for hot-topic selection details.\n5See Appendix D for all the prompts we use.\n6We use GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 until September 2024.

At the time of writing this paper, the\nsubset dataset we use from Daily Oracle consists of 16,783\nTF and 14,727 MC QA pairs, covering the period from\nJanuary 1st, 2020, to December 31st, 2024, with an average\nof 17.2 questions per day. Figure 1(a) shows that our dataset\ncovers various MC question types, mainly starting with\n“What will” (27.3%), “Who will” (21.2%), and “Which ...\nwill” (18.4%). Figure 1(b) provides a breakdown of the\ncategories, highlighting our dataset’s broad coverage. The\ncategorization of each question is determined using GPT-3.5,\nbased on the prompt from Halawi et al. (2024). Examples\nof QA pairs are shown in Table 2.\nPast and Future Information Usage. Each question in\nDaily Oracle implicitly requires the model to retrieve rel-\nevant knowledge. How do these requirements change day\nby day over the course of our benchmark?

Experiments\nWe first introduce three evaluation settings in Section 4.1:\n1) no access to external information, 2) access to retrieved\nrecent news articles, and 3) access to gold articles. Section\n4.2 presents the results, and Section 4.3 provides deeper\ninsights into the observed degradation patterns.\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nClosed-Book Setting. We evaluate various LLMs on\nDaily Oracle to assess their understanding of real-world\nevents and temporal generalization abilities, i.e., how ac-\ncurately LLMs can answer forecasting questions based on\nthe knowledge they learned from their training data. Our\nevaluation differentiates between two scenarios based on\nthe question’s resolution date and model’s knowledge cutoff\ndate: (1) Pre-Knowledge Cutoff Questions: These questions\nhave resolution dates before the model’s knowledge cut-\noff, testing the model’s understanding of past events. (2)\nPost-Knowledge Cutoff Questions: These have resolution\ndates after the knowledge cutoff, requiring models to pre-\ndict future events and test their forecasting and temporal\ngeneralization abilities.\nConstrained Open-Book Setting. In addition to a closed-\nbook evaluation, we explore the constrained open-book set-\nting: how access to news articles up to different time cut-\noffs influences LLM performance using RAG (Lewis et al.,\n2020). We introduce the concept of the RAG cutoff ( R-\nCutoff ), which limits the latest accessible date for retrieving\narticles. To prevent the models from leveraging information\nbeyond the resolution date, for any question with a resolu-\ntion date (dres), the accessible articles span from January 1st,\n2019 (the start of our news corpus) up to whichever comes\nfirst between the day before the resolution date and the RAG\ncutoff date (dR-Cutoff). Formally, the accessible date range\nis [01/01/2019, min(dres − 1, dR-Cutoff)). Following prior\nwork (Jin et al., 2021; Zou et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024),\nwe employ BM25 (Robertson et al., 1995) as the retriever\nand select the top 5 articles relevant to each question. We\ntruncate each retrieved article to a maximum length of 512\nwords. These articles are then incorporated into the input\nprompts to serve as additional information.\n5\nAre LLMs Prescient?

When comparing accuracies from the begin-\nning to the end of the evaluation period, we observe that,\non average, the models’ performance declines by 21.55%\non TF questions (from 64.68% to 50.74%) and by 11.33%\non MC questions (from 58.30% to 51.69%). This indicates\nthat while LLMs demonstrate certain abilities to understand\nreal-world events and make predictions, they struggle to\n6\n\n\n=== 2025_dai_daily_oracle_chunk_003.pdf ===\nAre LLMs Prescient? A Continuous Evaluation using Daily News as the Oracle\nmaintain these abilities.\nNotably, the average YoY accuracy declines provide further\ninsight. Before the knowledge cutoff, the average YoY\ndecline across all models was relatively moderate. However,\npost-knowledge cutoff, we observe steeper declines in\nmany models, with GPT-4 showing the most drastic drop\nin MC performance, declining by 18.54%, compared to just\n4.23% before the cutoff. This contrast highlights that while\nLLMs manage to retain a baseline of past knowledge with\nsmall degradation, their ability to forecast future events\ndeteriorates much more rapidly as they move beyond their\ntraining data, struggling with temporal generalization.\nAmong different models, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic,\n2024) significantly outperforms all others, while GPT-4\nexcels in MC questions but its performance in TF is not\nas remarkable as in MC. GPT-3.5, Qwen-2-7B (Yang\net al., 2024) and Llama-3-8B (Dubey et al., 2024) show\nsmaller temporal declines than GPT-4 in both TF and MC\nquestions. Interestingly, Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) and\nMixtral-8x7B (Jiang et al., 2024) show the most pronounced\ndrops in TF accuracy, with scores falling below the random\nbaseline 50% due to increased answer refusals, as shown\nin Figure 9. Gemma-2-2B (Team et al., 2024) exhibits the\nmost consistent performance with the smallest average YoY\ndecline, likely due to its more recent knowledge cutoff date.\nResults for the Constrained Open-Book Setting. In Fig-\nure 4, we present the results of the constrained open-book\nsetting, with Mixtral-8x7B on TF questions and Llama-3-\n8B on MC questions across different RAG cutoff dates. 8\nFor Mixtral-8x7B, as the RAG cutoff dates extend to closer\nto the resolution dates, we observe a clear improvement in\nperformance, indicating the model benefits from increas-\ningly updated information retrieval. However, there are\nnoticeable performance drops immediately after each RAG\ncutoff date when compared to providing information up\nto the day before the resolution date. This highlights the\nimportance of keeping up-to-date information for optimal\nRAG performance. Interestingly, RAG does not uniformly\nenhance performance. Llama-3-8B may perform worse than\nthe closed-book setting when the RAG cutoff is prior to the\nknowledge cutoff dates, suggesting outdated information\nmay negatively impact performance.

The WCEP con-\ntinuously documents current events and organizes\nevents on the same topic with the same subheaders,\neach with an event summary and at least one exter-\nnal link. These projects encompass extensive influ-\nencing and dramatic complex events across various\ndomains, satisfying our needs. After data scrap-\ning, we propose a multi-step filtration to remove\nduplicate, non-events, and non-contemporary data.\nSubsequently, we group articles on the same topic\ntogether, resulting in a large-scale high-quality col-\nlection of complex events.

Each complex event\nfrom Wikipedia contains multiple sections in one\narticle, whereas those from WCEP contain at\nleast one article. Leveraging LLMs, we pro-\npose a two-stage pipeline named extraction-then-\ncomplement. Specifically, for each complex event,\nwe sort articles by time and perform event time-\nline extraction on the first article, requiring that\nthe atomic events objectively occur. For Wikipedia\narticles, an additional preprocessing step is applied\nto retain only sections related to event evolution,\nsuch as introduction, background, development,\nand aftermath, thereby reducing the input length.\nThen, for the remaining articles, we sequentially\nconduct the event timeline complement, requiring\nthe LLMs to perform event extraction, coreference\nresolution, and event filling simultaneously. To\nensure chronological coherence, we perform an\nadditional reranking on the event timeline using\nLLMs. In our experiments, we observe that due to\nthe high complexity of event timeline completion,\nthe performance heavily depends on the capabilities\nof LLMs. When employing the stronger Llama3-\n70b, the performance of extraction is significantly\nimproved compared to Llama2-70b.\n4.3 Question Annotation\nFor the tasks STF and LTF, we randomly choose\none timestamp Tk specified in a day, partition CE\ninto background and target events, and form the\nsample as introduced in the task definition above.\nFor the AQA task, we randomly select one event\nfrom Y as the target event and an argument type\nfrom event category, time, location, subject, and\nobject as the target argument. Then, we leverage\nLLMs to design an argument-level question, such\nas \"When will\", \"What will\", \"Who will\", and\n\"Where will\", and extract its gold answer.\nFor the MCNC task, we randomly select one\nevent from Y as the gold answer. Then, we prompt\nLLMs to generate three challenging negative can-\ndidates by replacing event arguments (Jin et al.,\n2021) or generating opposite events. Additionally,\nrules such as ensuring negative candidates explic-\nitly not occur according to the given article are\nadded. To eliminate negative candidates that ac-\ntually occurred, we filter out those with the same\narguments as true events in the timeline (approxi-\nmately 7.3% are discarded). For the MCAC task,\nsimilar to the AQA task, three negative candidates\nare generated by LLMs. For the VQA task, we\nrandomly select the gold answer or one negative\ncandidate from samples in the MCNC task, assign-\ning labels with \"Yes\" and \"No\" respectively.\n4.4 Dataset Statistics\nTable 2 presents the comparison of OpenForecast\nwith other event forecasting datasets.

In this work, we train language models to make predictions\non open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we\nsynthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in\ndaily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train\nthe Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent\nleakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use\nan offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our\nforecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the\nbenefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform\nheld-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model,\nOpenForecaster8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our\ntraining improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions.\nWe find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize\nacross popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and\ndata to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.\n1 Introduction\nEvery day, people navigate decisions under uncertainty, due to incomplete evidence or\ncompeting hypotheses. The highest-stakes choices are inherently forward-looking: govern-\nments set policy while anticipating macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts; investors allocate\ncapital amid market and regulatory uncertainty; individuals choose careers as technologies\nevolve; and scientists pursue research directions in search of the next breakthrough. Decades\nof work (Tetlock et al., 2014) on human forecasting shows that while prediction is hard and\nskill varies widely, it is possible to train humans to become better forecasters. In fact, some\n“superforecasters” consistently outperform peers. While there is a ceiling to predictability in\nsocial systems (Franklin, 1999), we do not yet know where that ceiling lies in the real world.\nIf trained at scale for forecasting world events, Large Language Models (LLMs) may enjoy\nstructural advantages over humans: they can ingest and synthesize vast, heterogeneous\ncorpora across thousands of topics; and update predictions rapidly as new information\narrives. Just like language models now show superhuman reasoning on some exam-style\nmath and coding problems (OpenAI, 2025), in the future, language model forecasters may\nbe able to come up with possibilities that humans miss. So in this work, we study:\nHow can we train language models to better forecast open-ended questions?\nScaling training data for forecasting.As forecasting world events is hard for humans,\ndetailed and correct reasoning traces for forecasting are difficult to obtain. Fortunately,\nrecent success in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for language models enables training with\n∗Equal contribution †Equal co-supervision\n1\narXiv:2512.25070v2  [cs.LG]  5 Jan 2026\nFigure 1: A summary of our methodology for training language model forecasters.\njust the eventual outcome of the question (Guo et al., 2025). Further, the static knowledge\ncutoff of LLMs enables a unique opportunity: events that resolve after the cutoff are in the\nfuture for the model. Even then, sourcing questions at scale for training forecasting abilities\nhas a few key challenges. First, waiting for events to resolve is too slow as a feedback\nloop for training. Second, prediction markets–the primary source for existing forecasting\nquestions–mostly consist of binary yes or no questions. As there is a 50% chance of success\non these questions even with incorrect reasoning, they make for noisy rewards.\nInstead, we use global news, which covers a large number of salient events every day, to syn-\nthesize open-ended forecasting questions like “Who will be confirmed as the new prime min-\nister of Ukraine on 17 July 2025?”. Our recipe for creating training data is entirely automated\nand scalable, with one language model extracting events from news articles to generate\nquestions, and a different model filtering and rewriting questions to avoid leaking future in-\nformation. For this work, we use this recipe with 250,000 articles up till April 2025, to create\nOpenForesight, a dataset of∼ 50,000 open-ended forecasting questions for training. To grade\nresponses for open-ended questions, we use model-basedanswer matching(Chandak et al.,\n2025) consistent with frontier benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam (Phan et al., 2025).\nEnsuring we truly improve forecasting.We take extensive measures to avoid the leakage\nof future information during training and evaluation. First, we do not use online search\nengines for sourcing news, as they have unreliable date cutoffs due to dynamic updates to\ndocuments and search ranking (Paleka et al., 2025a). Instead, we use the CommonCrawl\nNews corpus, which provides static, monthly snapshots of global news. Second, we only\ntrain on events until April 2025, which is when the Qwen3 model weights we train were\nreleased. Finally, we do not observe performance on the test set until the very end. Our\ntest set is composed of diverse news sources, different from the ones used in training and\nvalidation, to ensure we are not just learning distributional biases of the training data.\nValidating design choices for LLM Forecasting Systems.We start from Qwen3 (Yang\net al., 2025) 4B and 8B models with thinking enabled. We perform all ablations on a small\nvalidation set. We use dense retrieval with the Qwen3-8B Embedding model to provide\nforecasters relevant chunks from our offline news corpus. Despite a cautious approach of\nonly retrieving articles untilone monthbefore the question resolution date to avoid leakage,\nthe retrieved information leads to large improvements. Then, we train language models\nusing RL with GRPO. For the reward function, we propose combining accuracy, and an\nadaptation of the brier score for open-ended responses (Damani et al., 2025). Ablations\nshow rewarding accuracy alone hurts calibration, while optimizing only the brier score\nhurts exploration on hard questions. Our final methodology is illustrated in Figure 1.\n2\nFinal results. In Section 6, we report results on our held-out test set of open-ended\nforecasting questions from May to August 2025, and FutureX (Zeng et al., 2025), an\nexternal forecasting benchmark. RL training on OpenForesight makes the predictions of our\nspecialized 8B model competitive with much larger proprietary models in both accuracy\nand calibration. We also observe large improvements on consistency evaluations for\nlong-term predictions (Paleka et al., 2025b). Finally, we find calibration from our forecasting\ntraining generalizes to multiple out of distribution benchmarks.\nBy providing rigorous probabilistic predictions, open-ended forecasting systems could\ntransform policy making, corporate planning, and financial risk management (Tetlock, 2017).\nTo promote forecasting research, we open-source our dataset, code, and models.\n2 Related Work\nForecasting World Events.Much prior work in Machine Learning and Statistics has focused\non forecasting numeric or time-series data (Box & Jenkins, 1976) in diverse domains like\nweather (Richardson, 1922), econometrics (Tinbergen, 1939) or finance (Cowles, 1933). In-\nstead, our work focuses on the prediction of discrete world events, with both questions and\nanswers described in natural language, also calledjudgemental forecasting(Tetlock & Gardner,\n2016). In the rest of our paper, we refer to this asforecastingfor brevity. In prior work on\nevaluating language models for forecasting (Zou et al., 2022; Karger et al., 2024), questions\nare primarily sourced from prediction markets like Metaculus, Manifold, and Polymarket.\nPrediction markets provide a platform for online participants to register predictions on ques-\ntions like “Will Donald Trump win the US Presidential Election in 2024?\", which mostly have\nbinary, yes or no, outcomes and have rapidly grown in popularity over the last few years.\nEvaluating LLMs for Forecasting.New information (before the event resolves) benefits\nforecasting. Thus, LLM forecasting work (Zou et al., 2022; Halawi et al., 2024) provides\nrelevant retrieved articles to models (Lewis et al., 2020) often obtained via web-search APIs.\nPaleka et al. (2025a) discuss pitfalls of LLM forecasting evaluations, including leakage of\noutcomes from online search in backtests, and distributional biases of prediction market\nquestions. To avoid these issues, we use static, monthly snapshots of global news for retrieval\nand creating questions. Jin et al. (2021) ask humans to create forecasting questions, while\nDai et al. (2024) try to automate this process with LLMs. However, their questions pre-define\na few outcomes to choose from. Guan et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2025) evaluate models on\nopen-ended forecasts, but we go a step further by showing how to train models for this task.\nReinforcement Learning for LLMs.Shao et al. (2024) proposedGroup Relative Policy\nOptimization(GRPO), an RL algorithm that only uses outcome rewards. This approach has\nbeen highly successful in training LLMs toreasonabout well-specified coding (Jain et al.,\n2024) and exam-style questions across domains (Phan et al., 2025). Instead, forecasting\nrequires LLMs to reason about uncertainty. Halawi et al. (2024) proposed training language\nmodels for forecasting by Supervised Finetuning (SFT) on chain of thought traces that lead\nto brier scores better than the prediction market aggregate. In the same setting of binary\nforecasting questions, Turtel et al. (2025a) optimize brier scores using GRPO, while Damani\net al. (2025) extend it to short answer questions in other domains. We depart from these\nworks in showing how to synthesise large-scale forecasting training data from daily news,\nto train models at open-ended reasoning about the future.\n3 Open-Ended Forecasting\nMotivation.The forecasting task we study isopen-endedin two key ways:\n1. It allows expressing arbitrary natural language forecasting questions\n2. It may not have a structured outcome set, unlike numeric or categorical predictions.\nThis differentiates it from both time-series forecasting, and prediction markets.\n3\n\n\n=== 2025_openforecaster_arxiv2512.25070_chunk_002.pdf ===\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

We\nintroduceKalshiBench, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from\nKalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring\nafter model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy\non static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately\nquantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five\nfrontier models—Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and\nKimi-K2—and findsystematic overconfidence across all models. Even the best-\ncalibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration\nerrors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibitworsecal-\nibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model\nachieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than\nsimply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced rea-\nsoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic\ncalibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.\n1 Introduction\nThe deployment of large language models in high-stakes domains—medical diagnosis, legal reasoning,\nfinancial forecasting—demands not only accuracy but alsocalibrated uncertainty. A model claiming\n“90% confidence” in a diagnosis should be correct approximately 90% of the time on similar cases.\nPoor calibration manifests as dangerous overconfidence (trusting wrong answers) or unnecessary\nunderconfidence (ignoring correct ones), fundamentally limiting the utility of model predictions for\ndecision-making under uncertainty [Guo et al., 2017].\nDespite extensive work on LLM capabilities, epistemic calibration—the alignment between ex-\npressed confidence and actual accuracy—remains understudied. Existing evaluations face two critical\nlimitations:\n(1) Static knowledge contamination.Traditional benchmarks assess models on questions whose\nanswers existed during training. A model may appear “calibrated” simply by having memorized facts\nwith appropriate confidence, rather than genuinely reasoning about uncertainty.\n(2) Lack of verifiable ground truth.Many calibration studies rely on human judgments or synthetic\ndatasets, introducing noise and potential biases in ground truth labels.\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\narXiv:2512.16030v1  [cs.AI]  17 Dec 2025\nModel Accuracy ECE↓\nClaude Opus 4.5 69.3%0.120\nKimi-K2 67.1% 0.298\nQwen3-235B 65.7% 0.297\nGPT-5.2-XHigh 65.3% 0.395\nDeepSeek-V3.2 64.3% 0.284\nKey Finding:All models exhibit systematic\noverconfidence. The gap between confidence and\naccuracy widens dramatically at high confidence\nlevels, with models averaging 27% error rate even\nwhen expressing>90% confidence.\nFigure 1: Summary of main results. While accuracy varies modestly (64-69%), calibration error\nvaries dramatically (3 × range). Reasoning enhancements (GPT-5.2-XHigh) worsen rather than\nimprove calibration.\nWe address both limitations throughKalshiBench, a benchmark leveraging prediction markets—\nspecifically Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange where contracts resolve to verifiable real-world\noutcomes. By temporally filtering questions to those resolvingaftermodel training cutoffs, we ensure\nmodels cannot have memorized outcomes, providing a clean signal for epistemic calibration.\nOur contributions are:\n1. KalshiBench: A temporally-filtered benchmark of 300 prediction market questions span-\nning 13 categories with verified ground truth outcomes, designed for rigorous calibration\nevaluation.\n2. Comprehensive evaluation: We assess five frontier models across classification (accuracy,\nF1) and calibration (Brier score, ECE, reliability diagrams) metrics, revealing systematic\npatterns.\n3. Novel findings: We demonstrate that (a) all current frontier models are overconfident, (b)\nreasoning enhancements degrade calibration, (c) only one model beats the base-rate baseline,\nand (d) calibration and accuracy are largely decoupled.\n2 Related Work\nCalibration in Neural Networks.Calibration has been extensively studied in classification settings\n[Guo et al., 2017, Minderer et al., 2021]. Modern deep networks are known to be overconfident [Guo\net al., 2017], with various post-hoc calibration methods proposed including temperature scaling [Guo\net al., 2017], Platt scaling [Platt, 1999], and isotonic regression [Zadrozny & Elkan, 2002]. However,\nthese methods assume access to held-out calibration data and primarily address discriminative rather\nthan generative models.\nLLM Uncertainty Quantification.Prior work on LLM calibration has examined confidence\nelicitation through verbalized probabilities [Tian et al., 2023, Xiong et al., 2024], multiple sampling\n[Wang et al., 2023], and logit-based approaches [Kadavath et al., 2022]. Kadavath et al. [2022]\nfound that larger models show improved calibration on factual questions, while Tian et al. [2023]\ndemonstrated that verbalized confidence often diverges from token probabilities. Recent work has\nexplored calibration in specific domains including medical question-answering [Singhal et al., 2023]\nand mathematical reasoning [Lightman et al., 2023].\nForecasting and Prediction Markets.Prediction markets aggregate collective intelligence to fore-\ncast uncertain events [Arrow et al., 2008, Wolfers & Zitzewitz, 2004]. Superforecasters demonstrate\nthat calibration is a learnable skill [Tetlock & Gardner, 2015]. Recent work has begun exploring\nLLMs as forecasters [Zou et al., 2022, Halawi et al., 2024]. Most relevant to our work, Forecast-\nBench [Karger et al., 2024] introduced a dynamic benchmark evaluating ML forecasting on 1,000\nautomatically-updated questions, finding that expert human forecasters significantly outperform the\nbest LLMs. However, ForecastBench focuses primarily on accuracy rather than calibration metrics.\nDistinction from Prior Work.Unlike existing benchmarks that assess calibration on static knowl-\nedge questions, KalshiBench uses temporally-filtered prediction market questions with verified\npost-training outcomes, eliminating knowledge contamination and providing clean calibration signals.\nCompared to ForecastBench, we focus specifically oncalibrationrather than raw forecasting accuracy,\n2\nproviding detailed analysis of reliability diagrams, overconfidence rates, and the relationship between\nconfidence and correctness.\n3 KalshiBench Dataset\n3.1 Data Source and Collection\nKalshiBench sources questions from Kalshi1, a CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange operating\nin the United States. Unlike informal forecasting platforms, Kalshi contracts have legally-binding\nresolution criteria, ensuring unambiguous ground truth. The full KalshiBench dataset contains1,531\ncleaned, deduplicated prediction market questionsspanning from September 2021 to November\n2025 across 16 categories, with a 42%/58% yes/no class split.\nFor our evaluation, we apply temporal filtering based on model knowledge cutoffs and randomly\nsample300 questions(random seed 42) from the filtered set. This sample size balances computational\ncost against statistical power, and exceeds the 200-question evaluation used in ForecastBench [Karger\net al., 2024].\n3.2 Temporal Filtering\nTo ensure models cannot have memorized outcomes, we apply strict temporal filtering based on\nmodel knowledge cutoffs:\nDfiltered ={(q, y)∈ D:t close(q)>max\nm∈M\ntcutoff(m)}(1)\nwhere tclose(q) is the resolution time of question q, tcutoff(m) is the knowledge cutoff of model m,\nand M is the set of evaluated models. For our evaluation, the effective cutoff is October 1, 2025 (the\nlatest among all models).\n3.3 Dataset Statistics\nTable 1: KalshiBench dataset statistics. The full dataset contains 1,531 questions; we evaluate on a\ntemporally-filtered sample of 300 questions (seed=42) resolving after October 1, 2025.\nFull Dataset Value Evaluation Sample Value\nTotal Questions 1,531 Sampled Questions 300\nCategories 16 Categories (in sample) 13\nDate Range 2021-09 to 2025-11 Date Range 2025-10 to 2025-11\nYes Rate 42.3% Yes Rate 40.0%\nTemporal Span 1,537 days Temporal Span 46 days\nTable 2: Category distribution in KalshiBench.

For instance, in the Iowa Electronic Market, traders buy and sell \ncontracts that pay $1 if a given candidate wins the election.  If a prediction market is \nefficient, then the prices of these contracts perfectly aggregate dispersed information \nabout the probability of each candidate being elected.  Markets designed specifically \naround this information aggregation and revelation motive are our focus in this article. \n \nTypes of Prediction Markets \n \nThe most famous prediction markets are the election forecasting markets run by \nthe University of Iowa (Berg, Forsythe, Nelson and Rietz, 2001).  Election forecasting \nprovides a useful way to introduce a variety of different contract types, and Table 1, \nadapted from Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2004a), shows how different contracts can be \ndesigned to reveal various types of forecasts. \n \n<Table 1 here> \n \nThe three main types of contracts link payoffs to the occurrence of a specific \nevent (the incumbent wins the election), a continuous variable (the vote share of the \nincumbent), or to a combination of the two, such as in spread betting.  In each case, the \nrelevant contract will reveal the market’s expectation of a specific parameter: a \nprobability, mean, or median, respectively.  More complex contract designs can also be \nused to elicit alternative parameters.  For instance, a family of winner-take-all contracts—\neach linked to different states of nature— can reveal the full probability distribution. \nPrediction markets have been used to forecast elections, movie revenues, \ncorporate sales, project completion, economic indicators and Saddam Hussein’s demise.  \nNew corporate applications have emerged as firms have looked to markets to predict \n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

We provide relevant analytic foundations, describing sufficient\nconditions under which prediction markets prices correspond with mean beliefs.  Beyond these\nspecific sufficient conditions, we show that for a broad class of models prediction market prices are\nusually close to the mean beliefs of traders.  The key parameters driving trading behavior in\nprediction markets are the degree of risk aversion and the distribution of beliefs, and we provide\nsome novel data on the distribution of beliefs in a couple of interesting contexts.  We find that\nprediction markets prices typically provide useful (albeit sometimes biased) estimates of average\nbeliefs about the probability an event occurs.\nJustin Wolfers\nBusiness and Public Policy Department\nWharton School, University of Pennsylvania\n3620 Locust Walk\nRoom 1456 Steinberg-Deitrich Hall\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6372\nand NBER\njwolfers@wharton.upenn.edu\nEric Zitzewitz\nGraduate School of Business\nStanford University \n518 Memorial Way\nStanford, CA 94305\nericz@stanford.edu\n1 \n1. Introduction \nIn a provocative recent paper, Charles Manski (2004) asked “What is the logical \nbasis for interpreting the price of an all-or-nothing futures contract as a market \nprobability that the event will occur?”  Moreover, he notes that “recent papers on \nprediction markets provide no formal analysis showing how such markets aggregate \ninformation or opinions.”  Manski poses an excellent question, and he highlights an \nimportant topic for research.  As prediction markets have become of more widespread \ninterest, the prices of contracts tied to events as diverse as the re-election of President \nBush, the ouster of Saddam Hussein, next month’s non-farm payrolls number, or the \nsuccess of specific products have been interpreted in both academic and popular \ndiscussion as though interchangeable with “the market’s beliefs”. \nThis paper presents an initial response to Manski’s challenge, providing a formal \nmodel which provides a plausible microfoundation under which one can treat prediction \nmarket prices as probabilities.  Further, we explore deviations from our baseline model, \nand show that for most plausible parameters, prediction market prices at least \napproximate the central tendency of the distribution of beliefs of traders.1  The specific \nmodel offered by Manski is a special case of our model, and while he emphasizes special \nassumptions that can lead his model to yield counter-intuitive results, we show that \nsensible distributions of preferences and beliefs yield more intuitive results. \nWe proceed as follows.  The next section sketches two very simple models in \nwhich prediction market prices coincide exactly with the mean of the belief among \ntraders.  The following section generalizes the model, showing that prediction market \nprices can deviate from mean beliefs, but that this deviation is typically small.  The extent \nof the deviation depends crucially on how widely dispersed beliefs are, and so in the final \nsection we present field evidence on this point.  To preview, our results suggest that \nwhile prediction market prices and mean beliefs may diverge, they are typically very \nclose.  We interpret our results as providing a microfoundation for the claim that \nprediction markets (approximately) efficiently aggregate beliefs. \n \n                                                 \n1 In concurrent work, Steven Gjerstad (2004) and Ottaviani and Sørensen (2006) derive a number of related \nresults. \n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
