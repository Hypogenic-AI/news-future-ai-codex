ABSTRACT
Temporal complex event forecasting aims to predict the future
events given the observed events from history. Most formulations
of temporal complex event are unstructured or without extensive
temporal information, resulting in inferior representations and
limited forecasting capabilities. To bridge these gaps, we innova-
tively introduce the formulation of Structured, Complex, and Time-
complete temporal event (SCTc-TE). Following this comprehensive
formulation, we develop a fully automated pipeline and construct
a large-scale dataset named MidEast-TE from about 0.6 million
news articles. This dataset focuses on the cooperation and con-
flict events among countries mainly in the MidEast region from
2015 to 2022. Not limited to the dataset construction, more im-
portantly, we advance the forecasting methods by discriminat-
ing the crucial roles of various contextual information, i.e., local
and global contexts. Thereby, we propose a novel method LoGo
that is able to take advantage of both Local and Global contexts
for SCTc-TE forecasting. We evaluate our proposed approach on
both our proposed MidEast-TE dataset and the original GDELT-TE
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
forecasting model LoGo. The code and datasets are released via

to facilitate disaster prevention or early warning in various areas,
such as civil unrests or regional conflicts. Due to its significant
value, event forecasting has garnered more and more interests from
the research communities.
Albeit the previous diverse formulations of TE forecasting, we
highlight three key properties that are crucial for both representa-
tion and forecasting of TE, i.e., Structured, Complex, and Time-
complete. First, structured representations, such as Temporal Knowl-
edge Graph (TKG) [ 3] or Temporal Complex Event (TCE) with
schema [23], are simple and flexible for indexing and query, and
the concise format of structured data enables the storing of large-
scale events with limited memory. In contrast, other unstructured
formulations, such as time series [31] or natural language [4], are
either non-flexible to represent multi-line of events or redundant
due to natural language representation. Second, Complex Event

(CE), which is composed by a set of atomic events [23], is capable of
capturing multiple actors, relations, and timelines, thus satisfying
various requirements in practice. Conversely, the formulations of
atomic event, such as GDELT [22] or ACE2005 [41], are restricted
to individual events that cannot model the complex scenarios or
even perform forecasting. Third and more importantly, the time-
complete characteristic, which means that every atomic event in a
certain complex event has its corresponding timestamp, is indispen-
sible. Some previous works [23] define a specifictemporal relation to
retain the temporal information within a complex event; however,
it requires 𝑂 (𝑁 2) temporal relations in order to fully preserve the
temporal information of a complex event that has 𝑁 atomic events.
As a result, the temporal relations are rarely complete due to the
quadratic relation space. In the summary as shown in Figure 1 (a),
to the best of our knowledge, none of previous formulations satisfy
all the three properties.
To bridge the gap, we borrow the merits of both TKG and TCE
with schema and propose a novel formulation to represent the
Structured, Complex, and Time-complete Temproal Event (SCTc-
TE). Specifically, as shown in Figure 1 (b), we define one SCTc-TE
as a list of semantically related and chronologically ordered graphs,
each of which consists of a set of atomic events that are occurring at
the same timestamp. We extend the atomic event formulation from
the quadruple in GDELT [22] to a quintuple (𝑠, 𝑟, 𝑜, 𝑡, 𝑐), where 𝑠, 𝑟,
𝑜, 𝑡 and 𝑐 represents the subject, relation 1, object, timestamp, and
CE, respectively. In contrast to TKG, where all the atomic events are
scattered, our formulation groups them into clusters, and each clus-
ter corresponds to a CE. More importantly, each atomic event has
an absolute timestamp, endowing our formulation with the time-
complete property. In order to implement this new formulation,
we develop a simple and fully automated pipeline, which utilizes
the pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and time-aware clus-
tering, to construct SCTc-TEs from news articles. Based on this
pipeline, we construct two large-scale event forecasting datasets,
MidEast-TE and GDELT-TE, from 0.6 million news articles.
Based on the newly proposed formulation and constructed datasets,
we design a novel TE forecasting method that is able to leverage
both local and global contexts. Given a particular query (𝑠, 𝑟, ?, 𝑡, 𝑐)
to be forecast, we term the historical events belonging to the same
complex event as the local context and all the historical events
as the global context. The local context preserves the most rele-
vant information that can be used to perform forecasting; while,
the global context, which is usually noisy and scattered, provides
a universal background that can also affect the evolution of cer-
tain complex events. For the example shown in Figure 1 (c), given
the complex event that mainly depicts the bilateral relationship
between countries X and Y, both the historical relations between
these two countries and the global contexts, such as Covid-19 pan-
demic, RU-UKR war, and Federate Reserve increase interest, will
affect the bilateral relations. However, previous approaches solely
rely on either the global context [19, 26] or the local context [23],
which is sub-optimal in forecasting complex events. In this work,
we propose to unify the modeling of both local and global con-
texts for TE forecasting. Concretely, we adopt two context learning
modules to separately learn the entity and relation representations

under the local and global context, respectively. An early-fusion
strategy followed by a decoder is then applied to achieve the final
forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms SOTA methods. The main contributions of this work
are as follows:
• To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose the SCTc-
TE formulation that encompasses all the structured, complex, and
time-complete properties of TEs.
• Based on the SCT-TCE formulation, we develop a fully automated
pipeline to construct TEs from news articles and construct two
large-scale datasets, MidEast-TE and GDELT-TE.
• We propose a novel method (LoGo) that captures both the local
and global contexts for SCTc-TE forecasting, and extensive evalu-
ations and experiments demonstrate the richness of our datasets
and the effectiveness of the proposed method.
2 PROBLEM FORMULATION AND DATASET
We first formally define the SCTc-TE and its forecasting task. Sec-
ond, we develop a pipeline to construct SCTs-TE from news articles,
as shown in Figure 2.
2.1 Problem Formulation
We define one SCTc-TE as a list of timestamped graphs G𝑐 =
[𝐺𝑐
1, 𝐺𝑐
2, · · ·, 𝐺𝑐
𝑡 ], where 𝑐 ∈ C is the identifier of one specific
Complex Event (CE) and C is the entire identifier set for all CEs;
and each graph is defined as 𝐺𝑐
𝑡 = {(𝑠𝑛, 𝑟𝑛, 𝑜𝑛, 𝑡, 𝑐)} 𝑁 𝑐
𝑡
𝑛=1, where
(𝑠𝑛, 𝑟𝑛, 𝑜𝑛, 𝑡, 𝑐) is the 𝑛-th atomic event in 𝐺𝑐
𝑡 and 𝑁 𝑐
𝑡 is the num-
ber of atomic events at timestamp 𝑡 for the CE 𝑐. In terms of each
atomic event, 𝑠 ∈ E , 𝑟 ∈ R , and 𝑜 ∈ E correspond to the subject
entity, relation, and object entity, respectively;𝑡 is the timestamp
when the certain atomic event occurs; E and R are the entity and
relation set, respectively. Typically, G𝑐 ∈ G is constructed based
on a list of timestamped document set D𝑐 = [𝐷𝑐
1, 𝐷𝑐
2, · · ·, 𝐷𝑐
𝑡 ] ∈ D ,
where G𝑐 is the local context for all the atomic events that the CE
𝑐 contains, while G is the global context that is a combined graph
of all the CEs C. D is the entire document set that consists of a list
of timestamped document set [D1, D1, · · ·, D𝑡 ]. Note that, both
𝐷𝑐
𝑡 and D𝑡 are a set of documents.
Given a set of document D, the SCTc-TE Construction task
aims to identify the CEs, i.e., D𝑐, from which we then extract the
atomic events and form the SCTc-TE graph G𝑐. Given a partial CE
G𝑐
≤𝑡 = [𝐺𝑐
1, 𝐺𝑐
2, · · ·, 𝐺𝑐
𝑡 ] and one query (𝑠, 𝑟, ?, 𝑡 + 1, 𝑐) at the next
timestamp, the SCTc-TE Forecasting aims to predict the object 𝑜.
2.2 SCTc-TE Construction Pipeline
We first introduce the domain and data sources that we used to
illustrate the pipeline. Following on, we explicate how to perform
event extraction using LLMs, then we present how to identify CEs
from news articles, and finally show the statistics and evaluations
of our datasets.
2.2.1 Domain and Data Sources. We construct our datasets based
on the GDELT [22] corpus, which is a large-scale TKG dataset that
has publicly accessible URLs of news articles. More importantly, it
follows a well-defined ontology,i.e., CAMEO [2], which is authentic

Extraction Prompt
You are an assistant to perform structured event extraction from news articles with following rules:
[Rules:] 1. Extract each event in format: event actor 1; event relation; event actor 2.
2. Only choose event relation from this relation candidate list: [Make public statement, Make an appeal or 
request, Express intent to cooperate, Consult or meet, Engage in diplomatic cooperation, Engage in material 
cooperation, Provide aid, Yield or concede, Investigate, Demand or order, Verbally disapprove, Reject, Threaten, 
Engage in political dissent, Exhibit military or police power, Reduce relations, Coerce, Use unconventional 
violence including terrorist, Use conventional military force, Use unconventional mass force].
3. Event actors are usually political actors, countries or international organizations.
4. Only extract events that have happened or is happening, and not extract future events.
[Example:] For example, given the example article:
Egypt committed to boosting economic cooperation with Lebanon (MENAFN- Daily News Egypt) Egypt is committed to 
enforcing economic cooperation with Lebanon, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi said during his meeting with Lebanese 
parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri.
List all events by rules, the extraction result of the example is:
Egypt; Express intent to cooperate; Lebanon | Egypt president Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi; Consult or meet; Lebanese 
parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri | Lebanese parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri; Consult or meet; Egypt president 
Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi
[News Article:] Now, given the query article:(𝒅𝒅

[Output:] List all events by rules, the extraction result of the query article is:

in describing international political events and curated by well-
known domain experts. As the original GDELT dataset is very
large, we follow the previous approaches [8, 9] and crop a subset
that is from three middle-east countries, i.e., Egypt (EG), Iran (IR),
and Israel (IS), for the period from 2015-02-19 to 2022-03-17. Then
we download the event news articles with valid URLs, excluding
those news articles of which the URLs are broken or inaccessible. To
improve the article quality, we further applied document filtering
steps by keeping popular and reliable news agencies and entities
based on their frequency descending order. This step can largely
reduce the amount of low-quality news articles, which are with
poor writing or even fake news. Finally, we keep 275,406 documents
which is about 47% of all successfully downloaded news articles.
2.2.2 Structured Event Extraction. Even though GDELT offers the
extracted structured atomic events, unfortunately, such extraction
results are prone to coarse-grained events and actors due to its
outdated rule-based extraction system built more than ten years
ago. Therefore, it is imperative to apply cutting-edge extraction
techniques to re-extract the events. Most of the existing EE stud-
ies [27, 39, 41] are supervised methods, which require high-quality
human-annotated datasets that are labor-intensive and expensive.
With the striking success of ChatGPT2 and GPT-4 [32], zero-shot in-
formation extraction without annotations becomes feasible [43, 49]
which demonstrates high potential. We thus leverage LLMs for EE
in a zero-shot paradigm. There are tens of optional commercial or
2https://chat.openai.com/
open-source LLMs emerging and fast evolving, we take the well-
performing open-sourced Vicuna-13b 3, because it is affordable
for general academic labs w.r.t. computational resources and time
considering million-level corpus.
Hierarchical Extraction. One major problem faced by LLM-
based EE falls in the input length limitation, especially since the
number of distinct atomic event types is over 200 and needs to be
input together with necessary extraction instructions and source
news articles. To solve this problem, we propose a hierarchical
extraction pipeline based on the three-level relation hierarchy in
CAEMO from coarse-grain to fine-grain. As shown in the bottom
of Figure 2, we first input the news article and the first-level atomic
event types, prompting the Vicuna to extract all the first-level
events, each including event subject, object, and one of the first-
level relations. We use the publish date of the news as the timestamp
of the extracted events. Then, we parse the first-level extraction
results. For each valid first-level event, we input its affiliated second-
level relations as options to the Vicuna model, together with the
original news article, thus obtaining the second-level extraction
results. The same procedure applies to the third-level extraction.
Note that we provide a ‘No specific’ choice for the sub-level relation
extraction, and in this case, the prior level relation will be kept.
Entity Linking. Since we do not have a pre-defined entity set
during EE, the extracted entities have free forms and multiple enti-
ties correspond to the same one. For example, the extracted entities
U.S.A and United States actually refer to the same actual entity. We
