1. Are LLMs Prescient? A Continuous Evaluation using Daily News as the Oracle
   - Authors: Hui Dai, Ryan Teehan, Mengye Ren
   - Year: 2025
   - Venue: ICML 2025 (PMLR 267)
   - File: 2025_dai_daily_oracle.pdf
   - Why relevant: Introduces Daily Oracle, a continuously updated forecasting benchmark built from daily news; directly evaluates LLM temporal generalization and forecasting under closed/open-book settings.

2. OpenForecast: A Large-Scale Open-Ended Event Forecasting Dataset
   - Authors: Zhen Wang, Xi Zhou, Yating Yang, Bo Ma, Lei Wang, Rui Dong, Azmat Anwar
   - Year: 2025
   - Venue: COLING 2025
   - File: 2025_openforecast_coling.pdf
   - Why relevant: Provides a large-scale open-ended event forecasting dataset and tasks; includes LLM-based evaluation for open-ended forecasts.

3. Scaling Open-Ended Reasoning To Predict the Future
   - Authors: Nikhil Chandak, Shashwat Goel, Ameya Prabhu, Moritz Hardt, Jonas Geiping
   - Year: 2026 (arXiv:2512.25070)
   - File: 2025_openforecaster_arxiv2512.25070.pdf
   - Why relevant: Trains LLMs on open-ended forecasting questions from daily news (OpenForesight) and reports RL-based improvements in accuracy and calibration.

4. Do Large Language Models Know What They Don’t Know? Evaluating Epistemic Calibration via Prediction Markets (KalshiBench)
   - Authors: Lukas Nel
   - Year: 2025 (arXiv:2512.16030)
   - File: 2025_kalshibench_arxiv2512.16030.pdf
   - Why relevant: Uses prediction market questions to evaluate LLM calibration on future events; supports the prediction-market component of the hypothesis.

5. ForecastQA: A Question Answering Challenge for Event Forecasting with Temporal Text Data
   - Authors: Jingqing Zhang, Yao Zhao, Mohammad Saleh, Peter J. Liu, Yang Liu
   - Year: 2021
   - Venue: ACL 2021
